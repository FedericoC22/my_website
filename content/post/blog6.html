<h3>My time volunteering for this association</h3>
<p>Since 2013, I committed a significant part of my life to volunteering for the association <strong>Mission MVC</strong> that supports poor families in South America by providing pre-fabricated houses to them.
During these several years as a volunteer and fundraiser I have learnt the beauty of making a purpose-driven impact.</p>
<p>Since the first time I went to Peru in 2013, I’ve been an active member of the fundraising team and in 2019 we accomplished to raise €185k for the 2019 volunteering projects in Peru and Colombia consiting on the construction of 20+ pre-fabricated houses.</p>

<h3>“Sosteniamoci”, a project launched during Covid-19 pandemic</h3>
<p>During the quarantine we launched a project called <strong>“Sosteniamoci”</strong> that was founded with the fundamental aim of providing basic necessities to families economically affected by COVID-19.
Since June we have organized 5 rounds of deliveries to 150+ families in Milan and Rome but we are now finishing our funds.</p>
<p>Please visit the website (it’s in italian but it’s intuitive ;) and if you like our project, make a donation here: <a href="https://www.sosteniamoci.org/store/" class="uri">https://www.sosteniamoci.org/store/</a></p>
