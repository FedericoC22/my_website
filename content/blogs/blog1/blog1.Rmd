# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
skim(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}
# As shown from the skim function, there are 1004 missing values for the "weight" variable
yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight),
          median_weight = median(weight),
          max_weight = max(weight),
          min_weight = min(weight),
          std_weight = sd(weight))

yrbss %>% 
ggplot(aes(x= weight)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Weight") +
  ylab("Frequancy") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of weight")

# The distribution is right skewed  

```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

  
```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

yrbss_table <- yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

yrbss_table
yrbss_table$prop[1]

```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?
```{r}
formula_ci <- yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>%
  summarise(count = n(),
            t_critical=qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_prop=sqrt(yrbss_table$prop[1]*(1-yrbss_table$prop[1])/count),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*se_prop,
            prop_low=yrbss_table$prop[1]-margin_of_error,
            prop_high=yrbss_table$prop[1]+margin_of_error)
formula_ci

```
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(y = reorder(physical_3plus, weight), x = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Physical activity does not affect weight", x = "weight", y = "physically active for at least 3 days a week")

# We expected physical activity to be a driver of weight however the data shows that that might not be the case 
```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean/SD, etc weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
#H0: The mean weights for people physically active or not show difference = 0.
#Ha: The mean weights for people physically active or not show difference != 0.

```


## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```



Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r}
null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()+
labs(title = "The null distirbution")
```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}

directors_ci <- movies %>%
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %>% 
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(
	mean_rating = mean(rating),
            sd_rating = sd(rating),
            count = n(),
            tcritical = qt(.975, count-1),
            ste = sd_rating/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = tcritical*ste,
            ci_low = mean_rating - margin_of_error,
            ci_high = mean_rating + margin_of_error
	)

ggplot(directors_ci,
       aes(y = reorder(director, mean_rating),
           x = mean_rating,
           colour = director)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_errorbar(width = .1, aes(xmin = ci_low, xmax = ci_high), lwd = 1.75) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean_rating,2)),hjust=0.5, vjust=-2,
            size=5) +
  geom_rect(mapping = aes(xmin = 7.27, 
                          xmax = 7.33, 
                          ymin = 0, 
                          ymax = 3), 
            colour = "grey", 
            alpha= 0.4) +
  labs(x = "Mean IMDB Rating",
       y = " ",
       title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB rating?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```

```{r}

# Ho: Mean rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton show difference = 0
# H1: Mean rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton show difference != 0

#use t.test
directors <- movies %>%
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) 
  t.test(rating ~ director, data = directors)

library(infer)
  
#use infer package
obs_diff_rating <-directors %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c('Steven Spielberg', 'Tim Burton'))

null_rating <- directors %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c('Steven Spielberg', 'Tim Burton'))

null_rating %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_rating, direction = "two-sided")

null_rating %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_rating, direction = "two_sided")

# With a p-value of 0.01 that is lower 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis and observe a significant difference

```

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}

# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval

summary_stat <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender)%>%
  summarize(
    mean_salary = mean(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
    sd_salary = sd(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
    count = n(),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1 ),
    se_salary = sd_salary/ sqrt(count),
    lower = mean_salary - t_critical * se_salary,
    upper = mean_salary + t_critical * se_salary) 

summary_stat

```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough
We can note that that the mean salary for female executives is signficantly lower than the mean salary for male executives. This difference is significant because the 95% CI for male executives is 70,088-73,390 and for female executives the CI is 61,486-67,599. The two CIs don't overlap.   


You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}

#H0: There is no difference between mean salaries of male and female 
#H1: There is significant difference between mean salaries of male and female 

  # hypothesis testing using t.test() 
  t.test(salary~gender, data=omega)

  # hypothesis testing using infer package
  set.seed(24)
  obs_diff_salaries <-omega %>% 
  specify(salary~gender) %>% 
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order=c("male","female"))

  salary_null <- omega %>%
    specify(salary~gender) %>%
    hypothesize(null="independence")%>%
    generate(reps=10000,type="permute")%>%
    calculate(stat="diff in means", order= c("male", "female"))

  salary_null %>%
    get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_salaries, direction="two-sided")


```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough


## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  



## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
ggplot(omega,aes(x=experience,y=salary,color=gender))+
  geom_point(size=4)+
  labs(x = "Years of experience",
       y = "Salary in USD",
       title = "Male executives at Omega tend to have more experience",
       subtitle = "Relationship between salary and years of experience")

```


## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

# The scatterplot shows that male executives are generally more experienced than female executives and that there is a positive relationship between salary amount and years of experience. The graph seems to suggest that the difference in salaries between male and female executives is driven by a difference in years of experience and not discrimination. 

# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this chllenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Ordering the var in ascending maturity order

    yield_curve$var,
    levels = c("3-Month Treasury Bill", "6-Month Treasury Bill", "1-Year Treasury Rate",  "2-Year Treasury Rate","3-Year Treasury Rate",  "5-Year Treasury Rate", "7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate","20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate")
  )

```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width = 6.5}
#Plot 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999
yield_curve %>% 
  filter(year(date)>= 1999) %>% 
  filter(maturity == '3m'|maturity == '10y') %>% 
  group_by(maturity) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date, price)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = var), alpha=0.5) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("turquoise3", "red2")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = 'Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999', x = '', y = '%', caption = 'Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)') +

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}
UN_GDP_data$IndicatorName %>% unique()

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols="1970":"2017",
    names_to = "year",  
    values_to= "value" 
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    year= year(as.Date(year, "%Y")),
    value = value/(10^9),
    IndicatorName= case_when(
           IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government expenditure",
           IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household expenditure",
           IndicatorName =="Gross capital formation"~"Gross capital formation",
           IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports",
           IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",
           IndicatorName == "Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables)" ~ "Gross fixed cap formation",
           IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~ "GDP",
           
           # Not shortening the indicator names that are already short
           TRUE ~ IndicatorName
           
         )
  )


glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?

```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
gdp_over_time <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName == c("Gross capital formation", 
                              "Household expenditure",
                              "Imports",
                              "Exports",
                              "Government expenditure"))


gdp_over_time %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=value, colour= IndicatorName)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=IndicatorName)) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP components over time",
    subtitle= "In constant 2010 USD",
    y="Billion US$",
    colour= "Components of GDP"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.title.x=element_blank()
  )
```



Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

```{r}
tidy_GDP_calculated <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(`Calc_GDP` = `Household expenditure` + `Gross capital formation` + `Government expenditure` + `Exports` - `Imports`,
         `% Change` = (`Calc_GDP` - `GDP`)/`GDP`)
```


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```



> Examining the plots, one can observe some similarities and differences between the components of GDP in each country. All 3 countries have household expenditure comfortably as the highest component of GDP, and this is to be expected (in the UK for example, “C” accounts for roughly 67% of total GDP and thus the values in the plot look normal). There are however variations in the trend of household income between the 3 countries. In Germany, “C” has remained fairly constant, dropping only during the financial crisis and reflecting lower disposable incomes during the period (leading to a lower propensity to consume).  Consumption in the US has been steadily increasing in this period, largely due to rising incomes and a deeply entrenched consumer culture that promotes spending beyond ones means. India has interestingly seen a decrease in household spending, and economists have theorised that this is down to an income growth slump in both urban and rural areas, causing people to kerb their spending.
Investment in Germany and the US has not seen tremendous variation, with the US showing its greatest increase in the period of growth in the late 90s and only significant fall predictably during the 2008 Financial Crisis. India on the other hand has seen sharp growth in investment, and this is almost certainly down to government policies aimed at attracting FDI and multinationals into the country, with investment a key driver of growth. 
Government spending predictably sits higher in Germany and the US  than India and this is expected, as government provision of public goods and services is higher in “developed” economies than “developing”. It is worth noting that the drop in US government spending is likely down to the culture of “small government” that began in the 1970s and has continued through till today.
Regarding net exports, Germany is the only country to have a positive figure, indicating that exports exceed imports. This is to be expected, as the country has a strong manufacturing sector and exports products worldwide. The other 2 countries are net importers, and this is once more to be expected as the US has moved away from manufacturing towards a service sector economy.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
